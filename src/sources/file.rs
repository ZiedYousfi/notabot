// Intentionally left empty.
// Concrete event source implementations (FileSource, DirectorySource, TcpSource)
// are defined in `sources/mod.rs`. This placeholder module exists only to avoid
// breaking references during refactors and to ensure no unused warnings surface
// if it's still included in the module tree.
